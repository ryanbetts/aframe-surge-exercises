# Intro to Aframe

This is a set of lessons to help introduce you to basic 3D & VR concepts using [Aframe](https://aframe.io/), the [Atom Text Editor](https://atom.io) with the [`atom-live-server`](https://atom.io/packages/atom-live-server) package installed. At the end of the exercise we will publish our work to the web using a command line tool called [`surge`](https://surge.sh).

This tutorial assumes a basic working knowledge of HTML, and access to a laptop and smartphone both on the same network.
