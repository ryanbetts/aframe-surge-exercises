    <!--
      Materials are what give objects their appearance. Up until this point
      all of the objects we've been using have had materials in them. When
      we have changed the colour of an object, we have really been changing the
      color of its material.

      Think of the material as the skin or clothes of an object.

      Look at the examples below: same object, same colour. But all three
      of them look different.

      Play with the properties of each to try and understand more about what
      is going on.

      Materials (as with lighting) are a very complex subject, so we won't
      spend much time on them today.

      BONUS: I've added an animation component to each torus so that you can
      see how the materials respond to the light better. But now you see just
      how easy it is to add an animation!
