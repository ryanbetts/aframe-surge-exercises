      You may have noticed in lesson 5 on primitives, I used a `layout` component
      to position the objects. This component is one of the many community written
      components that is not core to Aframe, but that can really speed up your
      prototyping.

      You can read more about it here:
      https://github.com/ngokevin/kframe/tree/master/components/layout/

      Try to arrange the boxes into a "henge" formation around you. As in
      Stonehenge.

      BONUS: perform a druidic ritual in the henge.
