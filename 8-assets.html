      Now that we know how to load images and videos, you might start to
      notice that bigger images and videos take a while to load.

      Sometimes you don't want your scene to render until all the images,
      videos, and other assets are available.

      No problem. Aframe has something called the <a-assets/> component.
      You can identify the assets to load, and refer to them by id elsewhere.
      Aframe will take care of waiting until they are available before rendering
      the scene.

      This is also helpful if you want to use the same image in numerous places,
      because you'll only have to change the image in one line.

      You can only have one of these per scene.

    <a-scene>
        <a-assets>
          <img id="cage-image" src="assets/cage.jpg"/>
          <img id="aframe-logo-video" src="assets/aframe-logo.mp4"/>
        </a-assets>
        <!-- <a-curvedimage src="assets/cage.jpg"></a-curvedimage> -->
        <a-image position="1 2 -2" src="#cage-image"></a-image>
        <a-video position="-1 2 -2" src="#aframe-logo-video"></a-video>
    </a-scene>
